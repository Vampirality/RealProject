# RealProject
  Replace integer/double with "Real" and do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with any real numbers!! Even to nearly infinite or nearly infinitesimal!!

  first-looking version for this project:
    - "Real Object" that obtain "Real Values", "Real Properties" and some fundamental functions, liked setting new value from pattern string.
    - "Real Operations" that obtain the four basic mathematic operations:
      - Real add(Real m, Real n)        : addition of m and n
      - Real minus(Real m, Real n)      : subtraction of m and n
      - Real multiply(Real m, Real n)   : multiplication of m and n
      - Real divide(Real m, Real n)     : division of m and n
